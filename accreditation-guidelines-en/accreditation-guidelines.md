# Objectives

This document provides guidelines for the evaluation of ISTQB<sup>®</sup> Foundation Level Training by Accreditation authorities (Member Boards or ISTQB<sup>®</sup> recognized Accreditation Boards). It provides guidance to training providers who want to create courses that will be successfully accredited.

Training is made up of two main parts: course material and trainer (also referred to as “tutor” or “instructor”).

The accreditation can be done for the course material only or for the entire training. In case only the accreditation of the course material is sought, subsection 2.4 Evaluation of Trainer must be omitted.

# Overall Rules

The following rules apply to the accreditation of the Foundation Level course material:

 | # | Rule name | Rule description 
 |------:|-----:|:------|
| 1   | Traceability and completeness | The course material to be accredited must demonstrably cover all applicable learning objectives. Accreditation applications shall include a traceability matrix showing coverage of the learning objectives in terms of presentation and supporting materials. |
| 2   | Learning Objectives | All K3 learning objectives require both lecture and exercises (see additional rules below). |
| 3   | Timing | Each chapter must be covered with at least as much time as required in the syllabus. Accreditation applications shall include a timing matrix showing the time allocated per chapter and section. |
| 4   | Content | The material discussed in each chapter and section of the Foundation Level syllabus must be presented. The presentation, exercises, exercise solutions and other course materials must be consistent with the material in the Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0. (Note: Course material may cover additional learning objectives, topics and/or additional terms. Accreditation authorities shall not consider these as part of the accreditation process unless contradictory with or derogatory towards the ISTQB<sup>®</sup> program, in which case accreditation shall be denied.) |
| 5   | Glossary | For any term defined, the course material must be consistent with the definition of that term in the version of the ISTQB<sup>®</sup> Glossary referenced by the Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0, or a later version. |
| 6   | Examples | All K2 and K3 learning objectives must contain at least one realistic software or systems project example. |
| 7   | Exercises and solutions | All K3 learning objectives must have at least one practical, non-trivial exercise drawn from a realistic software or systems project (see below). For live classes, all exercises must be solved by the students in class (i.e., not as optional or required homework) and a solution reviewed in class by the instructor. For e-learning or correspondence classes, an exercise solution must be provided in the course material. |
| 8   | Full review | Accreditation authorities may not use sampling methods (i.e., evaluating some sections instead of the full course). All materials provided with the course must be evaluated. |

# Evaluation Rules

## Evaluation of Examples

Any K2 and K3 Learning Objective (LO) must contain at least one example.

Examples must be appropriate for the module being taught and must be drawn upon realistic software or system projects, i.e., trainers must use computer-related projects. Ideally, examples should be drawn from real life occurrences.

## Evaluation of Exercises and Answers

Exercises must be appropriate for the module and K-Level taught, adapted to the module being taught and must be drawn upon realistic software or systems projects, i.e., trainers must use computer-related projects. Ideally, exercises should be substantiated and be drawn from real life occurrences. Each exercise should also include solutions.

## Evaluation of Trainer Notes

If the slides are not self-explanatory or are a direct copy of the syllabus without supporting text, notes about what trainers are expected to say on each section should be available. These “trainer notes” can be “presenter notes” in the slides or a separate document.

## Evaluation of Trainer

Trainers must hold at least the certification that they are teaching. In case a trainer has a Certified Tester Foundation Level Certificate older than v.4.0, he also must have the Agile Tester Foundation Level Certificate. Accreditation authorities may select additional criteria to accredit trainers (e.g., consulting experience, etc.). If such is the case, the additional criteria will be made public before the accreditation request is sent. Accreditation authorities are reminded that training experience and (practical) testing experience are required, and that presenting at conferences does not cover the same skills as lecturing in a training course.

## Evaluation of Additional Material

If trainers reference additional material (such as books or articles not referenced in the Foundation Level syllabus), they shall provide that material to the Accreditation authority and ensure that this material is not in conflict with the Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0 and other ISTQB® syllabi.

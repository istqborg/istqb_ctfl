### Syllabus - version v4. {-}

On March 26 , 2021 , the ISTQB® General Assembly voted on and approved the development of a new version v4.0 of the syllabus Certified Tester Foundation Level (CTFL). The goal was to make the syllabus more SDLC agnostic, whilst blending in concepts, techniques and approaches coming from incremental and iterative SDLCs such as SCRUM, agile and XP. A joint ISTQB® work group, comprised of the FLWG (Foundation Level Work Group) and AWG (Agile Work Group) has developed the new version according to the ISTQB® development process and released it on April 21, 2023.

This version is a major update, because it more than 5% changes of Learning Objectives, as described in the ISTQB® Accreditation Process...

A major update does require re-accreditation of training providers and training materials: the accreditation body must review the material and confirm that adjustments to the Syllabus changes have been properly implemented.

**The new version v4.0 of the syllabus comes into effect on the launch date May 9 th, 2023**

All ISTQB® Member Boards which currently provide the CTFL Syllabus in English must:

1. retire the previous version of the CTFL Syllabus in English
1. for the English language only use the current version 4.0 of the CTFL Syllabus in their market no later than 12 months after the launch date.

All ISTQB® Member Boards which currently provide exams in the CTFL Syllabus version 3.1 in English must ensure that all exam questions are valid in relation to the CTFL Syllabus version 4.0 no later than 6 months after the launch date.

All ISTQB® Member Boards which currently provide CTFL Syllabus version 4.0 in their local language must:

1. retire their old CTFL Syllabus version 4.0 translated to their local language
1. and either provide an updated / new translation of CTFL Syllabus version 4.0 in their local language
1. or only use the English version of the CTFL Syllabus version 4.0 in their market no later than 18 months after the launch date.

All ISTQB® Member Boards which currently provide exams for the CTFL Syllabus version 3.1 in their local language must ensure that all exam questions are valid in relation to the CTFL Syllabus version 4. 0 no later than 18 months after the launch date.

The effect of this rule is that there will be no further activity at any ISTQB® Member Board regarding the previous 3.1 version of the Syllabus from 12 months after the launch date in English, and from 18 months after the launch date in non-English.

**Change log**

Training Providers, Exam Providers, Member Boards and Students of the Syllabus should at least be aware of the changes listed below.

General:

 - Even though a fair amount of business outcomes (BOs) and learning objectives (LOs) are transferred from CTFL 3.1 and CTFL-AT, every single one of the BOs and LOs has been evaluated and revamped or reworded where needed.
 - Additional BOs and LOs were identified and thus added to this version of the syllabus
 - The knowledge levels of the LOs was assessed and adapted where applicable.
 - The entire syllabus was re-written, following a test-first approach: sample exam questions were derived from the approved LOs before the syllabus content was written, to verify the testability of the LOs
 - The keywords were aligned with those present in the ISTQB Glossary

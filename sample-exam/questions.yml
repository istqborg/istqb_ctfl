    question: Which of the following statements describe a valid test objective?
    answers:
      a: To prove that there are no unfixed defects in the system under test
      b: To prove that there will be no failures after the implementation of the system into production
      c: To reduce the risk level of the test object and to build confidence in the quality level
      d: To verify that there are no untested combinations of inputs
    correct: c
    explanation: |
      a) Is not correct. It is impossible to prove that there are no defects anymore in the system under test. See testing principle 1
      b) Is not correct. See testing principle 7
      c) Is correct. Testing finds defects and failures which reduces the level of risk and at the same time gives more confidence in the quality level of the test object
      d) Is not correct. It is impossible to test all combinations of inputs (see testing principle 2)

    question: Which of the following options shows an example of test activities that contribute to success?
    answers: 
      a: Having testers involved during various software development lifecycle (SDLC) activities will help to detect defects in work products
      b: Testers try not to disturb the developers while coding, so that the developers write better code
      c: Testers collaborating with end users help to improve the quality of defect reports during component integration and system testing
      d: Certified testers will design much better test cases than non-certified testers
    correct: a
    explanation: |
      a) Is correct. It is important that testers are involved from the beginning of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). It will increase understanding of design decisions and will detect defects early
      b) Is not correct. Both developers and testers will have more understanding of each other's work products and how to test the code
      c) Is not correct. If testers can work closely with system designers, it will give them insight as to how to test
      d) Is not correct. Being certified does not automatically mean that the tester will be better in test design

    question: You have been assigned as a tester to a team producing a new system incrementally. You have noticed that no changes have been made to the existing regression test cases for several iterations and no new regression defects were identified. Your manager is happy, but you are not. Which testing principle explains your skepticism?
    answers:
      a: Tests wear out
      b: Absence-of-errors fallacy
      c: Defects cluster together
      d: Exhaustive testing is impossible
    correct: a
    explanation: |
     a) Is correct. This principle means that if the same tests are repeated over and over again, eventually these tests no longer find any new defects. This is probably why the tests all passed in this release as well
     b) Is not correct. This principle says about the mistaken belief that just finding and fixing a large number of defects will ensure the success of a system
     c) Is not correct. This principle says that a small number of components usually contain most of the defects
     d) Is not correct. This principle states that testing all combinations of inputs and preconditions is not feasible

    question: |
      You are testing a user story with three acceptance criteria: AC1, AC2 and AC3. AC1 is covered by test case TC1, AC2 by TC2, and AC3 by TC3. The test execution history had three test runs on three consecutive versions of the software as follows: 
      <TBD TABLE>
      Tests are repeated once you are informed that all defects found in the test run are corrected and a new version of the software is available.
      Which of the above tests are executed as regression tests?
    answers:
      a: Only 4, 7, 8, 9
      b: Only 5, 7
      c: Only 4, 6, 8
      d: Only 5, 6
    correct: b
    explanation: |
      Because TC1 and TC3 failed in Execution 1 (i.e., test (1) and test (3)), test (4) and test (6) are confirmation tests. 
      Because TC2 and TC3 failed in Execution 2 (i.e., tests (5) and (6)), test (8) and test (9) are also confirmation tests. 
      TC2 passed in Execution 1 (i.e., test (2)), so test (5) is a regression test. TC1 passed in the Execution 2 (i.e., test (4)), so test (7) is also a regression test.

    question: Which of the following is a characteristic of experience-based test techniques?
    answers:
      a: Test cases are created based on detailed design information
      b: Items tested within the interface code section are used to measure coverage
      c: The techniques heavily rely on the tester’s knowledge of the software and the business domain
      d: The test cases are used to identify deviations from the requirements
    correct: c
    explanation: |
      a) Is not correct. This is a common characteristic of white-box test techniques. Test conditions, test cases, and test data are derived from a test basis that may include code, software architecture, detailed design, or any other source of information regarding the structure of the software.
      b) Is not correct. This is a common characteristic of white-box test techniques. Coverage is measured based on the items tested within a selected structure and the technique applied to the test basis
      c) Is correct. This is a common characteristic of experience-based testtechniques. This knowledge and experience include expected use ofthe software, its environment, likely defects, and the distribution of those defects is used to define tests
      d) Is not correct. This is a common characteristic of black-box test techniques. Test cases may be used to detect gaps within requirements and the implementation of the requirements, as well as deviations from the requirements

      You are testing a simplified apartment search form which has only two search criteria:
      
      * floor (with three possible options: ground floor; first floor; second or higher floor)
      * garden type (with three possible options: no garden; small garden; large garden)
      
      Only apartments on the ground floor have gardens. The form has a built-in validation mechanism that will not allow you to use the search criteria which violate this rule.
      Each test has two input values: floor and garden type. You want to apply equivalence partitioning (EP) to cover each floor and each garden type in your tests.
      What is the minimal number of test cases to achieve 100% EP coverage?
    answers:
      a: '3'

      c: '5'
      d: '6'
    correct: b
    explanation: |
      “Small garden” and “large garden” can go only with “ground floor”, so we need two test cases with “ground floor” which cover these two “garden type” partitions. We need two more test cases to cover the two other “floor” partitions and a remaining ”garden type” partition of “no garden”. 
      We need a total of four test cases:
      TC1 (ground floor, small garden)
      TC2 (ground floor, large garden)
      TC3 (first floor, no garden)
      TC4 (second or higher floor, no garden)

    correct: d
    explanation: |
      “test” and “error” transitions cannot occur in one test case. Neither can both “done” transitions. This means we need at least three test cases to achieve transition coverage. For example:
      TC1: test, done
      TC2: run, error, done
      TC3: run, pause, resume, pause, done

    question: Your test suite achieved 100% statement coverage. What is the consequence of this fact?
    answers:
      a: Each instruction in the code that contains a defect has been executed at least once
      b: Any test suite containing more test cases than your test suite will also achieve 100% statement coverage
      c: Each path in the code has been executed at least once
      d: Every combination of input values has been tested at least once
    correct: a
    explanation: |
      a) Is correct. Since 100% statement coverage is achieved, every statement, including the ones with defects, must have been executed and evaluated at least once
      b) Is not correct. Coverage depends on what is tested, not on the number of test cases. For example, for code “if (x==0) y=1”, one test case (x=0) achieves 100% statement coverage, but two test cases (x=1) and (x=2) together achieve only 50% statement coverage
      c) Is not correct. If there is a loop in the code there may be an infinite number of possible paths, so it is not possible to execute all the possible paths in the code
      d) Is not correct. Exhaustive testing is not possible (see the seven testing principles section in the syllabus). For example, for code “input x; print x” any single test with arbitrary x achieves 100% statement coverage, but covers one input value

    question: Which of the following is NOT true for white-box testing?
    answers:
      a: During white-box testing the entire software implementation is considered
      b: White-box coverage metrics can help identify additional tests to increase code coverage
      c: White-box test techniques can be used in static testing
      d: White-box testing can help identify gaps in requirements implementation
    correct: d
    explanation: |
      a) Is not correct. The fundamental strength of white-box test techniques is that the entire software implementation is taken into account during testing
      b) Is not correct. White-box coverage measures provide an objective measure of coverage and provide the necessary information to allow additional tests to be generated to increase this coverage
      c) Is not correct. White-box test techniques can be used to perform reviews (static testing)
      d) Is correct. This is the weakness of the white-box test techniques. They are not able to identify the missing implementation, because they are based solely on the test object structure, not on the requirements specification

    question: Which of the following BEST describes the concept behind error guessing?
    answers:
      a: Error guessing involves using your knowledge and experience of defects found in the past and typical errors made by developers
      b: Error guessing involves using your personal experience of development and the errors you made as a developer
      c: Error guessing requires you to imagine that you are the user of the test object and to guess errors the user could make interacting with it
      d: Error guessing requires you to rapidly duplicate the development task to identify the sort of errors a developer might make
    correct: a
    explanation: |
      a) Is correct. The basic concept behind error guessing is that the tester tries to guess what errors may have been made by the developer and what defects may be in the test object based on past experience (and sometimes checklists)
      b) Is not correct. Although a testers who used to be a developer may use their personal experience to help them when performing error guessing, the test technique is not based on prior knowledge of development
      c) Is not correct. Error guessing is not a usability technique for guessing how users may fail to interact with the test object
      d) Is not correct. Duplicating the development task has several flaws that make it impractical, such as the tester having equivalent skills to the developer and the time involved to perform the development. It is not error guessing

    question: In your project there has been a delay in the release of a brand-new application and test execution started late, but you have very detailed domain knowledge and good analytical skills. The full list of requirements has not yet been shared with the team, but management is asking for some test results to be presented. Which test technique fits BEST in this situation?
    answers:
      a: Checklist-based testing
      b: Error guessing
      c: Exploratory testing
      d: Branch testing
    correct: c
    explanation: |
      a) Is not correct. This is a new product. You probably do not have achecklist yet and test conditions might not be known due to missing requirements
      b) Is not correct. This is a new product. You probably do not have enough information to make correct error guesses
      c) Is correct. Exploratory testing is most useful when there are few known specifications and/or there is a pressing timeline for testing
      d) Is not correct. Branch testing is time-consuming, and your management is asking about some test results now. Also, branch testing does not involve domain knowledge

    question: Which of the following BEST describes the way acceptance criteria can be documented?
    answers:
      a: Performing retrospectives to determine the actual needs of the stakeholders regarding a given user story
      b: Using the given/when/then format to describe an example test condition related to a given user story
      c: Using verbal communication to reduce the risk of misunderstanding the acceptance criteria by others
      d: Documenting risks related to a given user story in a test plan to facilitate the risk-based testing of a given user story
    correct: b
    explanation: |
      a) Is not correct. Retrospectives are used to capture lessons learned and to improve the development and testing process, not to document the acceptance criteria
      b) Is correct. This is the standard way to document acceptance criteria
      c) Is not correct. Verbal communication does not allow to physically document the acceptance criteria as part of a user story (”card” aspect in the 3C’s model)
      d) Is not correct. Acceptance criteria are related to a user story, not a test plan. Also, acceptance criteria are the conditions that have to be fulfilled to decide if the user story is complete. Risks are not such conditions

      Consider the following user story:
      *As an Editor*
      *I want to review content before it is published*
      *so that I can assure the grammar is correct*

      and its acceptance criteria:

      * The user can log in to the content management system with "Editor" role
      * The editor can view existing content pages
      * The editor can edit the page content
      * The editor can add markup comments
      * The editor can save changes
      * The editor can reassign to the "content owner" role to make updates

      Which of the following is the BEST example of an ATDD test for this user story?
    answers:
      a: Test if the editor can save the document after edit the page content
      b: Test if the content owner can log in and make updates to the content
      c: Test if the editor can schedule the edited content for publication
      d: Test if the editor can reassign to another editor to make updates
    correct: a
    explanation: |
      a) Is correct. This test covers two acceptance criteria: one about editing the document and one about saving changes
      b) Is not correct. Acceptance criteria cover the editor activities, not the content owner activities
      c) Is not correct. Scheduling the edited content for publication may be a nice feature, but it is not covered by the acceptance criteria
      d) Is not correct. Acceptance criteria state about reassigning from an editor to the content owner, not to another editor

    answers:
      a: Testers determine the priority of the user stories to be developed
      b: Testers focus only on the functional aspects of the system to be tested
      c: Testers participate in the detailed risk identification and risk assessment of user stories
      d: Testers guarantee the release of high-quality software through early test design during the release planning
    correct: c
    explanation: |
      a) Is not correct. Priorities for user stories are determined by the business representative together with the development team
      b) Is not correct. Testers focus on both functional and non-functional aspects of the system to be tested
      c) Is correct. According to the syllabus, this is one of the ways testers add value to iteration and release planning
      d) Is not correct. Early test design is not part of release planning. Early test design does not automatically guarantee the release of quality software

      c: Estimated defect density is reached
      d: Requirements are translated into given/when/then format
      e: Regression tests are automated
    correct: c,e
    explanation: |
      a) Is not correct. Test environment readiness is a resource availability criterion; hence it belongs to the entry criteria
      b) Is not correct. This is a resource availability criterion; hence it belongs to the entry criteria
      c) Is correct. Estimated defect density is a measure of diligence; hence it belongs to the exit criteria.
      d) Is not correct. Requirements translated into a given format result in testable requirements; hence it belongs to the entry criteria
      e) Is correct. Automation of regression tests is a completion criterion; hence it belongs to the exit criteria

      *Application hangs up* 
      *2022-May-03 – John Doe – Rejected*
      *The application hangs up after entering “Test input: $ä” in the Name field on the new user creation screen. Tried to log off, log in with test_admin01 account, same issue. Tried with other test admin accounts, same issue. No error message received; log (see attached) contains fatal error notification. Based on the test case TC-1305, the application should accept the provided input and create the user. Please fix with high priority, this feature is related to REQ-0012, which is a critical new business requirement.*

      What critical information is MISSING from this test report that would have been useful for the developers?

      b: References and defect status
      c: Test environment and test item
      d: Priority and severity
    correct: c

      a) Is not correct. The expected result is “the application should accept the provided input and create the user”. The actual result is “The application hangs up after entering “Test input. $ä””
      b) Is not correct. There is a reference to the test case and to the related requirement and it states that the defect is rejected. Also, the defect status would not be very helpful for the developers
      c) Is correct. We do not know in which test environment the anomaly was detected, and we also do not know which application (and its version) is affected
      d) Is not correct. The defect report states that the anomaly is urgent, that it is a global issue (i.e., many, if not all, test administration accounts are affected) and states the impact is high for business stakeholders

      b: Test analysis and design
      c: Test implementation and execution
      d: Test completion
    correct: c

      a) Is not correct. Test monitoring involves the ongoing checking of all activities and comparison of actual progress against the test plan. Test control involves taking the actions necessary to meet the test objectives of the test plan. No test data are prepared during these activities
      b) Is not correct. Test analysis includes analyzing the test basis to identify test conditions and prioritize them. Test design includes elaborating the test conditions into test cases and other testware. Test data are not prepared during these activities
      c) Is correct. Test implementation includes creating or acquiring the testware necessary for test execution (e.g., test data)

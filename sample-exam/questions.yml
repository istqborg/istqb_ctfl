    question: Which of the following statements describe a valid test objective?
    answers:
      a: To prove that there are no unfixed defects in the system under test
      b: To prove that there will be no failures after the implementation of the system into production
      c: To reduce the risk level of the test object and to build confidence in the quality level
      d: To verify that there are no untested combinations of inputs
    correct: c
    explanation: |
      a) Is not correct. It is impossible to prove that there are no defects anymore in the system under test. See testing principle 1
      b) Is not correct. See testing principle 7
      c) Is correct. Testing finds defects and failures which reduces the level of risk and at the same time gives more confidence in the quality level of the test object
      d) Is not correct. It is impossible to test all combinations of inputs (see testing principle 2)

    question: Which of the following options shows an example of test activities that contribute to success?
    answers: 
      a: Having testers involved during various software development lifecycle (SDLC) activities will help to detect defects in work products
      b: Testers try not to disturb the developers while coding, so that the developers write better code
      c: Testers collaborating with end users help to improve the quality of defect reports during component integration and system testing
      d: Certified testers will design much better test cases than non-certified testers
    correct: a
    explanation: |
      a) Is correct. It is important that testers are involved from the beginning of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). It will increase understanding of design decisions and will detect defects early
      b) Is not correct. Both developers and testers will have more understanding of each other's work products and how to test the code
      c) Is not correct. If testers can work closely with system designers, it will give them insight as to how to test
      d) Is not correct. Being certified does not automatically mean that the tester will be better in test design

    question: You have been assigned as a tester to a team producing a new system incrementally. You have noticed that no changes have been made to the existing regression test cases for several iterations and no new regression defects were identified. Your manager is happy, but you are not. Which testing principle explains your skepticism?
    answers:
      a: Tests wear out
      b: Absence-of-errors fallacy
      c: Defects cluster together
      d: Exhaustive testing is impossible
    correct: a
    explanation: |
     a) Is correct. This principle means that if the same tests are repeated over and over again, eventually these tests no longer find any new defects. This is probably why the tests all passed in this release as well
     b) Is not correct. This principle says about the mistaken belief that just finding and fixing a large number of defects will ensure the success of a system
     c) Is not correct. This principle says that a small number of components usually contain most of the defects
     d) Is not correct. This principle states that testing all combinations of inputs and preconditions is not feasible

      You work in a team that develops a mobile application for food ordering. In the current iteration the team decided to implement the payment functionality
      Which of the following activities is a part of test analysis?
    answers: 
     a: Estimating that testing the integration with the payment service will take 8 person-days
     b: Deciding that the team should test if it is possible to properly share payment between many users
     c: Using boundary value analysis (BVA) to derive the test data for the test cases that check the correct payment processing for the minimum allowed amount to be paid
     d: Analyzing the discrepancy between the actual result and expected result after executing a test case that checks the process of payment with a credit card, and reporting a defect
    correct: b
    explanation: |
     a) Is not correct. Estimating the test effort is part of test planning
     b) Is correct. This is an example of defining test conditions which is a part of test analysis
     c) Is not correct. Using test techniques to derive coverage items is a part of test design
     d) Is not correct. Reporting defects found during dynamic testing is a part of test execution

    question: |
      Which of the following factors (i-v) have SIGNIFICANT influence on the test process?

      i. The SDLC
      ii. The number of defects detected in previous projects
      iii. The identified product risks
      iv. New regulatory requirements forcing formal white-box testing
      v. The test environment setup
    answers:
      a: i, ii have significant influence
      b: i, iii, iv have significant influence
      c: ii, iv, v have significant influence
      d: iii, v have significant influence
    correct: b
    explanation: |
      i.    Is true. The SDLC has an influence on the test process
      ii.   Is false. The number of defects detected in previous projojects may have some influence, but this is not as significant as i, iii and iv
      iii.  Is true. The identified product risks are one of the most important factors influencing the test process
      iv.   Is true. Regulatory requirements are important factors influencing the test process
      v.    Is false. The test environment has no significant influence on the test process

      Hence b is correct.

    question: Which TWO of the following tasks belong MAINLY to a testing role?
    answers: 
      a: Configure test environments
      b: Maintain the product backlog
      c: Design solutions to new requirements
      d: Create the test plan
      e: Report on achieved coverage
    correct: a, e
    explanation: 
      a) Is correct. This is done by the testers
      b) Is not correct. The product backlog is built and maintained by the product owner
      c) Is not correct. This is done by the development team
      d) Is not correct. This is a managerial role
      e) Is correct. This is done by the testers

      Which of the following skills (i-v) are the MOST important skills of a tester?
    
      i. Having domain knowledge
      ii. Creating a product vision
      iii. Being a good team player

     a: ii and iv are important
     b: i, iii and v are important
     c: i, ii and v are important
     d: iii and iv are important
    correct: b
    explanation:
      i.  Is true. Having domain knowledge is an important tester skill
      ii. Is false. This is a task of the business analyst together with the business representative
      iii. Is true. Being a good team player is an important skill
      iv. Is false. Planning and organizing the work of the team is a task of the test manager or, mostly in an Agile software development project, the whole team and not just the tester
